I am a dad, a drummer, and an IT guy that lives in Texas.  I work in authentication currently, handling SSO. SAML, OIDC, OAuth2. One of my sons told me that I like computers 'too much.'  Maybe so.  I also really like mechanical keyboards, history, city planning, and messing around with static site generators.
