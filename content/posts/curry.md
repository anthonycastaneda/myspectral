#### **Instructions:**

### **1. Marinate the Chicken:**

- In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt.
- Mix well and let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour (you can marinate it overnight in the fridge for more depth of flavor).

### **2. Prepare the Curry Base:**

- Heat oil in a large pot or deep pan over medium heat.
- **Add whole spices**: Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves. Let them splutter for 30 seconds to release their flavors.
- **Onions**: Add the finely chopped onions and sauté them until golden brown, which usually takes around 7-10 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.
- **Ginger-Garlic Paste**: Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the raw smell disappears.
- **Green Chilies**: Add the green chilies, slicing them lengthwise if you want the curry to be spicier.

### **3. Add Tomatoes and Spices:**

- Add the chopped tomatoes (or crushed tomatoes) to the pan and cook until they soften and the oil begins to separate from the masala (spice paste), about 5-7 minutes.
- Add **turmeric powder**, **ground coriander**, **ground cumin**, **red chili powder**, and **fennel** (optional). Stir well and let the spices cook for another 2-3 minutes to release their flavors.
- Add **garam masala** and stir everything together.

### **4. Add the Chicken:**

- Add the marinated chicken pieces into the pan and stir to coat them with the spice mixture. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the chicken is slightly browned and the spices start to cling to the meat.

### **5. Add Liquid and Simmer:**

- Pour in the water or chicken broth, depending on how thick or thin you want the curry to be. Stir everything together, ensuring the chicken is submerged.
- Bring the curry to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium-low and cover. Let the curry cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is tender and fully cooked through. If you want a thicker curry, cook it uncovered for the last 10 minutes to reduce the liquid.
  
### **6. Final Touches:**

- Once the curry reaches your desired consistency, stir in coconut milk or cream (if using). This will add a creamy richness to the curry and balance out the heat from the spices.
- Taste and adjust the seasoning by adding more salt, chili powder, or garam masala if necessary.
- Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice for a burst of freshness.

### **Serving Suggestions:**

- Serve the chicken curry hot with **steamed basmati rice**, **naan bread**, or **roti**.
- You can also serve it alongside a side of **pickles** or a simple cucumber salad for a refreshing contrast to the rich curry.

### **Tips for Authentic Flavor:**

- **Use Fresh Spices**: The freshness of your spices can dramatically change the flavor of the curry. Try to use whole spices (cumin seeds, cardamom pods) and grind them yourself for the best taste.
- **Layering Spices**: Cooking the spices in stages (as mentioned) allows each one to release its oils and flavors, building a more complex curry.
- **Let it Rest**: Chicken curry tastes even better the next day, so if you have time, let it sit and rest for a few hours or overnight in the fridge to let the flavors develop further.
